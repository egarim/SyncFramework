Folder Description

The "api/Audit" endpoints are intended to view database history changes (aka Audit Trail). No data changes made via your ORM in Web API endpoints will be unnoticed.
You can also view this audit log in your RDBMS or XAF's administrative UI for WinForms, Blazor, or ASP.NET WebForms.
These additional services/benefits of our Web API Service ship as part of the DevExpress Universal Subscription (https://www.devexpress.com/buy/net/).
